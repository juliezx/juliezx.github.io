          <h3>Ode to a Cube 2018 | Card Stock, Foam Board, Cardboard</h3>
          <p>For this project, I was assigned to create a sculpture model involving a cube and a base at a scale of 1” = 1’- 0.” As shown in the sketches, I was trying to create an abstract and minimalist look with the structure. Initially, I chose the design on the bottom left (starred) as my favorite, but as I made all the pieces, I realized that I had cut the triangular joints at a wrong angle. In attempt to remedy the mistake, I changed my design to something more interactive with the hidden T-pins on both ends to secure the cube’s position. It is named “Arrival” like the movie because the cube mysteriously hangs above the ground like the alien ship in the movie. I can see this being 10 feet tall and displayed in front of a museum.
